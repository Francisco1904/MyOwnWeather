## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **API Integration**: Axios with WeatherAPI.com
- **State Management**: React hooks with LocalStorage

## Development Approach

This project was developed using modern development workflows, including:

- **Component-based architecture**: Building reusable UI components
- **Mobile-first design**: Ensuring great experience on all devices
- **API integration**: Connecting to weather data services
- **AI-assisted development**: Leveraging AI tools for productivity enhancements and problem-solving

I believe in embracing modern tools that enhance productivity while maintaining full understanding of the code being written. Using AI assistance for certain aspects of development allowed me to focus on architecture decisions and user experience improvements.
